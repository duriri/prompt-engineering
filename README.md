# ✍🏻 Prompt Engineering Patterns 

💁🏻‍♀️Welcome to the **Prompt Engineering Patterns Repository**, a comprehensive resource dedicated to the art and science of crafting effective prompts for large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Claude, and Mistral. Prompt engineering involves designing precise and contextually appropriate inputs to elicit optimal outputs from LLMs, balancing creativity and technical rigor.

This repository provides a curated collection of **prompting techniques**, each accompanied by clear explanations, practical examples, and use cases. These patterns are designed to be reusable across various tasks, including text generation, reasoning, code synthesis, and more, enabling practitioners to achieve consistent and high-quality results.

##  📑 Why Prompt Engineering Matters

Prompt engineering is critical because the structure, phrasing, and context of a prompt significantly influence an LLM's performance. Research shows that well-crafted prompts can improve model accuracy and relevance, especially in complex tasks like reasoning or creative writing (Brown et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021). By leveraging repeatable prompt patterns, users can reduce trial-and-error, streamline workflows, and adapt techniques to diverse applications.

## 🧧 Prompting Techniques

This repository covers the following widely adopted prompt engineering techniques, each detailed in its own dedicated subdirectory:

- **Chain of Thought (CoT)**: Encourages step-by-step reasoning to enhance performance on logical, mathematical, and analytical tasks.
- **Few-Shot Prompting**: Provides input-output examples to guide the model, ideal for tasks where fine-tuning is unavailable.
- **Zero-Shot Prompting**: Relies on clear instructions without examples, leveraging the model's pre-trained capabilities.
- **Role Prompting**: Assigns a specific persona or role to the model to tailor tone, style, or expertise.
- **Self-Consistency**: Uses multiple model responses with majority voting to improve reliability in reasoning tasks.

Each technique includes a detailed README with definitions, examples, and best practices, making this repository a practical toolkit for researchers, developers, and AI enthusiasts.

## 🎨 Getting Started

To explore the patterns:
1. Navigate to the subdirectory of the desired prompting technique.
2. Review the README for an overview, use cases, and example prompts.
3. Experiment with the provided examples using your preferred LLM platform.
4. Adapt and extend the patterns to suit your specific tasks.
